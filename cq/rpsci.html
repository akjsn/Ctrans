                You must be familiar with this classic hand game of rock-paper-scissors.
            </p>

            <p>
                Write a program to simulate a game of rock-paper-scissors between two players.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your program should allow continuous input.<br>
                Your program should also be able to track the scores of the two players.
            </p>

            <p>
                Input instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>First, input a number n. This number represents the points needed to win the game.</li>
                    <li>Next, for each line, input two uppercase characters representing the moves by Player 1 and Player 2, separated with a space.<br>
                    Input R for rock, P for paper, and S for scissors.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>As the game goes on, output who wins the round.<br>
                        Output "Player 1 wins" if Player 1 wins; or "Player 2 wins" if Player 2 wins; and the winning player gets a point.<br>
                        If there is a draw, output "Draw" (neither player earns points if a draw happened).</li>
                    <li>If there are characters outside the abovementioned permitted characters, output "Error".<br>
                    Neither player earns a point in that round.</li>
                    <li>In either case, output the current score of both players.</li>
                    <li>Once a player reaches the points needed to win the game, output "Player 1 has won the game!" if Player 1 wins; or "Player 2 has won the game!" if Player 2 wins.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
