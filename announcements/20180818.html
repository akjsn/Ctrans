                    <p>
                       Welcome to the new translation webpage!! 
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        First, I would like to thank you for supporting Kuolao's Computer Programming translation project. This (not really) project started in 2017 using Microsoft Word documents, and in the spring semester of 2018 this webmaster (to be?) happened to take the Web Programming course in Taipei Tech (if you're reading this and you are a Taipei Tech student, you can take this course in the spring semester of your sophomore (2nd) year), and I decided to sort of apply the stuff grabbed off that course and build a <s>wall</s> webpage dedicated for that.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        The motivation for me to make this website is that I wanted a tidier, well-arranged presentation of future tasks, and I also wanted to make a better-presented course webpage. One inspiration I got in the process is Dr. Chuan-Ming Liu's (劉傳銘 教授) Data Structures course webpage.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        I know this website does not use sophisticated technology, but for me, the ability to express what we want to say in our webpage in a clear way is the most important thing.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        Special thanks to Dr. Jong-Yih Kuo (郭忠義 教授) for allowing me to start this project in first place, and also Dr. Chi-Shan Yu (俞齊山 教授) and his team (Ms. Yun-Chien Cheng (鄭芸茜 老師) plus Mr. Harry Lin (林泓志 老師)) for the knowledge about Web Programming.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        With that, let's get started.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        P.S. I know this website is still far from perfect -- if you have any suggestions on how to improve the website, feel free to contact the webmaster via the Contact page.
