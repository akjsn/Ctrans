                    My laptop is currently being sent for repairs because of a problem with the screen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Expect assignment translation uploads to be delayed during this time -- I may have to visit the campus to do updates, and unfortunately, since October 10 is Taiwan's National Day, looks like the computer rooms will not open, so expect the new stuff uploaded on Thursday when I can use the computer rooms again.
                </p></s>

                <p>Since the repair shop does not open on October 10, I will be sending in the laptop for repair the day after, so, expect update delays for next week, as the staff told me that the repair will take one week. I will try to use other methods to keep you updated while my laptop is under repair...</p>

                <p>
                    In addition, I just realized that I uploaded the wrong assignments for week 4; these have been fixed earlier today.
                </p>

					I do apologize for any inconvenience caused.
