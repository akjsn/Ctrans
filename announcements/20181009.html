                <p>
                    My laptop is currently being sent for repairs because of a problem with the screen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Expect assignment translation uploads to be delayed during this time -- I may have to visit the campus to do updates, and unfortunately, since October 10 is Taiwan's National Day, looks like the computer rooms will not open during that day, so expect the new stuff uploaded on Thursday when I can use the computer rooms again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, I just realized that I uploaded the wrong assignments for week 4; these have been fixed earlier today.
                </p>
				
				<p>
					I do apologize for any inconvenience caused.
