                       It's been fun.
                    </p>
					
					<p>
						However, due to the many stuff I am doing right now: <a href="https://csie.ntut.edu.tw/csie/Chinese/06Students/st_sp.html" target="blank">final project</a>, part-time (maybe?), chasing credits (I'm getting sick of calculus tbh, I just want to get that out of my system), class duties and wot not, I have decided that I will be ending support for this website.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If I got the time and chance in the future, I may revamp this website using more advanced technology, and if possible, once the new website is done, I might hand over the operations to Kuolao's Intelligent Systems Lab.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Thank you for all the support this past year, and enjoy the remaining days of summer.

					<ul style="color:white;font-size:8pt">
					<li>screwed up OS and calculus (when I found out I crashed out calculus, I tried to hide my emotions since I was in Kaohsiung, but then things went worse over the next few days when I returned to Taipei; I literally screamed FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU- at an intersection the same night I knew I messed up OS, and when it was confirmed that I fell out in OS while I was in Fengyuan, I cried all the way back to Taipei)
					<li>didn't get an internship (<a href=https://youtu.be/k4V3Mo61fJM style="color:white" target="blank">when you are confident that you will get an internship this summer,</a> and then you <a href=https://youtu.be/zLOQjk6oZ9g?t=15 style="color:white" target="blank">balatkar</a> so horribly)
					<li>worked on part time job for only two days before being put on indefinite standby (and Mom said that rather than I work as a [REDACTED] I'd better find a part time job that is related to what I am majoring in right now, which angered me further)
					<li>messed up social relationships as well (all because of <a href=https://youtu.be/e8HRTlkGD4Q style="color:white" target="blank">Conflict</a>)
					</li></ul>
					<p style="color:white;font-size:8pt">fml QAQ</p>
					<p style="color:white;font-size:6pt">P.S. I paid $3075 for calculus summer course -- if I crash out again I will definitely explode. I could've used that to go to <a href=https://www.lihpaoresort.com/LihpaolandApp/Multilingual/index?id=1 style="color:white" target="blank">Lihpao</a> or whatever it is...</p>
