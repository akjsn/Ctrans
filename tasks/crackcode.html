                Mr. Chang, a rich landowner, stores all his valuables in a safe. The safe is equipped with a password lock. Mr. Chang writes the clues to open the safe on a scroll, and he decides to inherit his wealth to his only son. The contents of the scroll are two lines of sentences, made of alphabets, numbers, spaces, and punctuation marks. The instructions for cracking the code are as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>The first sentence contains n numbers. Take the numbers from the sentences and align them to the left. Add up all the digits in the same column, and concatenate the results to form a new number.
                        Do note that:
                        <ul>
                            <li>only number places which contain a digit in all the numbers from the sentence will be counted. For example, if we have the numbers 1015, 213, 91872, and 32, the calculation steps will be as follows:
                                <img src="codecrack/1.JPG" class="diag">
                                From the above example, columns indicated with a ↓ contain a digit in all the numbers.
                            </li>
                            <li>The resulting number must be 4 digits long.<br>
                                If the number has more than 4 digits, then take the last 4 digits.<br>
                                If the number has less than 4 digits, then add 0 to the missing spaces in the beginning.<br>
                            </li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>For the second sentence, count the appearance of every letter in that sentence. Take the frequency of 4 letters with the most number of appearances (but not exceeding 9), and arrange them based on where the letter is first seen to form another 4-digit number.<br>
                        Note that UPPERCASE CHARACTERS and lowercase characters are considered different characters.
                            </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Input instruction: Input two sentences, which contain alphabets, numbers, spaces, and punctuation marks.           
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instruction: Output the 8-digit password in one line.
