                Using A String To Fix A Sentence

                Spring 2018: Question 27 (use C language to write this program)
            </h6>

            <p> <!-- content-->
                In this exercise, you have to write a program to read a text in English, and perform operations and modifications on the text based on given commands.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Once the program starts running, the pointer is at the first character of the text. The operation commands are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>0: Moves the pointer to the first character of the text.</li>
                    <li>$: Moves the pointer to the end position of the text (i.e. the position NEXT to the last character in the text).</li>
                    <li>x: Removes the character at the current position of the pointer. If the pointer is at the end position of the text, nothing will be removed.</li>
                    <li>s: Swaps the character at the current position of the pointer with the character at the right of the pointer. If the pointer is at the end position of the text, or is at the last character of the text, nothing will be done.</li>
                    <li>i: Inserts a character at the current position of the pointer. The character input is the character immediately after the i command. For example, if the command is ix, then x is input at the current position of the pointer. The pointer will stay at its current position after adding the character, i.e. the new character will be the character at the right of the pointer.</li>
                    <li>u: If the character in the current position of the pointer is an English alphabet, the letterâ€™s case will be changed to upper case. Regardless of the character in the current position of the pointer, the pointer will move one space to the right at the end of this operation.</li>
                    <li>+: Moves the pointer one space to the right.</li>
                    <li>-: Moves the pointer one space to the left.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Input instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In the first line, input a sentence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the second line, input a series of commands to fix the sentence.
                    </li>
                </ol>               
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instruction: Output the modified sentence.
            </p>

            <table border=1px>
                <tr>
                    <th width=50%>Sample Input</th>
