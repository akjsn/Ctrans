                Checking Assignments
            </h2>

            <h6>
                Spring 2019: Question 27 (use C language to make this program)
            </h6>

                A teaching assistant places assignments that need to be checked by putting them on a stack. This means that the assignment placed at the bottom of the stack will be the last assignment to be checked. If a student comes to the teaching assistant to hand in that assignment (note that the submission is already considered <i>late</i> at this point), that assignment will be placed on the top of the stack, therefore, the assignment which was just handed in by the student will be the next assignment to be checked.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, a day in the life of a teaching assistant is not dedicated completely to checking assignments -- a teaching assistant still has other things to do, such as attending classes, working on projects, and what not. <span style=color:white>助教辛苦了！</span> Therefore, the teaching assistant may not be able to finish correcting assignments in one day. At the end of the day, when the teaching assistant signs out, find out whose assignments have not been checked.
            </p>

            <p>
                Use the following code to define the structure of an assignment.
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="code">
                            typedef struct Homework{ <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char name[10]; //student name<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int isDelay; //if submitted late then True, else False<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;struct Homework *next;	<br>
                                }HW; 
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </p>

            <p>
                Input instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>First, input a series of names, one at a time. Names entered first represent assignments that are submitted earlier, and are placed at the bottom of the stack.</li>
                    <li>Input -1 to end the abovementioned input.</li>
                    <li>Next, there are three functionss:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Input 1, followed by the student name if there is a late submission. This will add the assignment to the top of the queue. Remember to mark this assignment as a late submission.</li>
                            <li>Input 2 to correct the assignment of one student (i.e. remove one assignment from the top of the stack).</li>
                            <li>Input 3 to sign out.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>                
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>For Function 2, output the name of the student whose assignment was corrected, and also output whether the assignment was submitted late or not.</li>
                    <li>For Function 3, output all the student names whose assignments have not been corrected, and also output whether the assignment was submitted late or not.</li>
                    <li>If, when 2 or 3 is input, there are no assignments in the stack, output "Empty".</li>
                </ol>    
            </p>
