                <a href="bowling.html">After a few weeks,</a> Xiao Ming goes to the bowling alley for another game of bowling.</p>
                        
            <p>
                Xiao Ming has played eight frames, so he now has only two frames left in his game. Let's assume Xiao Ming did not score anything in the first 8 frames (it's been a few weeks, but too bad Xiao Ming still can't properly bowl...). Please calculate the total score earned for the remaining two frames.
            </p>
			
			<p>
                The rules are the same as in <a href="bowling.html">the earlier bowling exercise</a>, with the following additional rules:
				<ul>
				<li>A player can roll the second ball in a frame if the player did not knock down all 10 pins in the first roll. Otherwise, the frame ends.</li>
				<li>If a player knocks down all 10 pins in the tenth frame, the player can roll for a third time.</li>
				</ul>
            </p>
			
			<p>
				Scoring rules:
				<ol>
				<li>One point is awarded for every pin knocked down. The total number of pins knocked down in two throws must be less than 10.<br>
				For example, if 7 pins and 2 pins are knocked down in the first and second throw, respectively, input: 7 2.<br>
				The player gets a total of 7 + 2 = 9 points for the frame.</li>
				<li>If all pins are knocked down in two hits, then the player gets a <b>SPARE</b>.<br> The player can add the total number of pins knocked down in the next one roll into the score.<br>
				For example, if 7 pins and 3 pins are knocked down in the first and second throw, and in the throw after that, 5 pins are knocked down, input: 7 3.<br>
				If the spare happens in the tenth frame, input: 7 3 5 0 (note: you can only throw at most three times in the tenth frame!)<br>
				<img src="bowling/sparedemo.JPG">
				<img src="bowling/sparedemo10.JPG"><br>
				The player gets a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 points for the frame with the spare.</li>
				<li>If all pins are knocked down in one hit, then the player gets a <b>STRIKE</b>. If a player gets a strike, the player cannot throw another ball for that frame.<br> The player can add the total number of pins knocked down in the next two rolls into the score.<br>
				For example:
				<ul>
				<li>if a player gets a strike, and in the two throws following that, 5 pins and 2 pins are knocked down, input: 10 0.<br>
				If the strike happens in the tenth frame, input: 10 0 5 2.<br>
				<img src="bowling/strikedemo.JPG">
				<img src="bowling/strikedemo10.JPG"><br>
				The player gets a total of 10 + 5 + 2 = 17 points for the frame with the strike (if the strike happened in the tenth frame, the 0 is not counted towards the final score).</li>
				<li>if a player gets a <a href="https://www.bowling.com/article_bowling_term_glossary.aspx" target="_blank">turkey</a> (three strikes in a row), input 10 0.<br>
				If the turkey happens in the tenth frame, input: 10 0 10 10.<br>

            <p>Input instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>Input the scores for each throw in the remaining two frames, one line for each throw.</li>
                    <li>If all the pins are knocked out in the tenth frame, input the score for the extra throw(s) <b>in the same line</b>.</li>
                </ol>
