            </h6>

            <p> <!-- content-->
                One day, a snake found a pile of fresh, juicy fruits (well, the ones that the snake can digest)! However, the snake is afraid of The Snake King knowing about the pile of fruits, so it hides the fruits somewhere in the great world, and makes a map of the location of the treasure.                
            </p>

            <p>
                The Snake King found out about the pile of fruits, anyway. </p>

            <p>
                After a scuffle with The Snake King, the snake managed to defend its pile of fruits, but, unfortunately, it lost its ability to understand the map it made.<br>
                The snake needs your help to find its way to its hidden pile of fruits!
            </p>

            <p>
                Rules:
                <ol>
                    <li>This map is 20-by-20 in size, with the top left corner being (0, 0).</li>
                    <li>The map is bordered by a wall; do not go out of bounds -- the game will end if the snake goes out of bounds!</li>
                    <li>The snake's starting position is at (9, 9).</li>
                    <li>The snake has a starting length of 1.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>Input instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>First, input the number of fruits in the map (from 1 to 10).</li>
                    <li>Next, input the location of each fruit in the map, with each number separated with a space.</li>
                    <li>Then, input one of the following numbers for snake movement:
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 to make the snake face up</li>
                            <li>2 to make the snake face down</li>
                            <li>3 to make the snake face left</li>
                            <li>4 to make the snake face right</li>
                            <li>5 to make the snake move one space</li>
                            <li>0 to display the snake's current length and covered position.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Input is performed until -1 is input, or if the snake touches the wall or itself.</li>
                    <li>Note that in the beginning, the snake faces right. If a snake eats a fruit, its body will grow by one space.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instruction: Whenever 0 or -1 is input, or when the snake hits a wall or itself, output the current length of the snake and the coordinate spaces covered by the snake before any of the numbers are input. Output the length first, then the coordinates.
            </p>
