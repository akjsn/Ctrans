                Fall 2018: Question 28 (use Python to write this program)<br>
                Fall 2017: Question 41 (use C language to write this program)
            </h6>

            <p> <!-- content-->
                In this program, a four-digit number X using numbers from 0 to 9 is preset. The numbers do not repeat.
            </p>
			
			<p>
				A user inputs a four-digit number as well as the similarity of the number to X, and this four-digit number is compared with X.
			</p>

            <p>
                The process to determine similarities will be as follows:
				<ol>
				<li>If there is a number that matches the number in the answer, and is also in the same position as the position of the number in the answer, note this down as nA (n being the amount of numbers that satisfy this rule).<br>
				For example: if X is 1234, and the user guesses 1856, record this as 1A.</li>
				<li>If there is a number that matches the number in the answer, but not in the same position as the position of the number in the answer, note this down as nB (n being the amount of numbers that satisfy this rule).<br>
				For example: if X is 1234, and the user guesses 8561, record this as 1B.</li>
				<li>Rule (1) takes priority over Rule (2).</li>
				<li>Input will be given until X is guessed.</li>
				</ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Input instruction: For every line, input a four-digit number guess, as well as the similarity of that number to X.      
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instruction: Output the correct answer X.
