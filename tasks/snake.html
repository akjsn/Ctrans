                Spring 2018: Question 37 (use C language to write this program)
            </h6>

            <p> <!-- content-->
                Using a linked list, simulate the gameplay of the snake game we all have ever played in older mobile phones.
            </p>
            
            <p>Game rules:
                <ol>
                    <li>At the start of the game, the snake has an initial length of 5.</li>
                    <li>The game field is quadrilateral, and has a size of 10 x 10, and each space in the game field is marked, from (0, 0) to (9, 9), as follows:<br>
                        <img src="snake/grid.jpg" class="diag"></li>
                    <li>At the start of the game, the snake’s head is at (4, 0), and the snake’s tail is at (0, 0).<br>
                        <img src="snake/start.jpg" class="diag"></li>
                    <li>The system must decide if the move input is legal; and the game can continue if the input is legal. Illegal moves are defined in Point 6 of the game rules.</li>
                    <li>The snake’s body will grow by 1 if it eats a food item.</li>
                    <li>If any of the following occur, then the move becomes illegal (and there will be no position changes):
                        <ul>
                            <li>snake goes out of bounds (x < 0 or y < 0 or x > 9 or y > 9)</li>
                            <li>snake touches any part of its own body<br>
                                For example: When the snake’s tail is at (7, 2) and the snake’s head is at (7, 1), the snake wants to move down to (7, 2) – which is not possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Input instruction: For each line of input, input the coordinates (x, y) for the location of the food item, and the movements made by the snake (one character represents the snake moving one space in the direction given – u (up), d (down), l (left), r (right)), all separated with a space.         
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>If the snake fails to reach the food item, output “Fail”.</li>
                    <li>If the snake reaches the food item, output “Success”.</li>
                    <li>If any of the situations described in point 6 of the game rules (illegal moves) occur, output “Game Over” and end the program.</li>
                </ol>          
            </p>
