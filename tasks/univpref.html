                A final year high school student is deciding which university would he/she go for further studies. There are many universities in the area, and each university has its own features, as shown:
                <ul>
                    <li>BC: Big Campus</li>
                    <li>NC: Next to City -- university is located close to a big city.</li>
                    <li>CT: Convenient Transportation </li>
                    <li>NS: Next to Sea -- university is located by the sea.</li>
                    <li>NM: Next to Mountain -- university is located in the mountainside.</li>
                    <li>HL: Has Lake -- the university features a lake.</li>
                    <li>NL: Near Landscape -- university is located near a scenic area.</li>
                </ul> 
                Among the features, the user can define his/her desired features. If more than one feature set is desired, then + can be used to define an OR relationship.<br>
                For example: <span class="console">BC NS + CT HL</span> means that we are looking for universities which have a big campus and are located by the sea, <u>or</u> universities with convenient transportation and a lake.
            </p>

                    <li>For the next <i>n</i> lines, input a string of words, with the first word being the name of the university (no more than 10 characters), and the remaining words being the university's features (two characters each). </li>
                    <li>Then, input the number of queries to be done <i>m</i> (not exceeding 10).</li>
                    <li>Then, for the next <i>m</i> lines, input the search criteria by providing the university's feature(s).<br>
                        Features can be separated with or without a space.<br>
                        <b>The presence of a + defines an OR relationship, otherwise an AND relationship will be defined.</b>
