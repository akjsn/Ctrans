                Fall 2018: Question 35 (use Python to write this program)
            </h6>

            <p> <!-- content-->
                There are four suits in a standard deck of poker cards: spades, <span style="color:red">hearts</span>, <span style="color:red">diamonds</span>, and clubs.<br>
                In this exercise, these suits are defined as S, H, D, and C, respectively.<br>
                Each suit contains 13 cards from 1 to 13, for a total of 52 cards in four suits.<br>
                In this exercise, the values of the cards are from 2 to 13. An Ace (A) has a value of 14.
            </p>

            <p>Rank of suits: Spade > Heart > Diamond > Club</p>

            <p>
                In this program, each card has a code in this format: number and suit.<br>
                For example, 10S represents the 10 in spades, 7D represents the 7 in diamonds, and 12C represents the Queen of clubs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Write a program to determine the rank of a hand of cards in a poker game.
            </p>

            <p>
                Input instruction: Input the ID of five cards, separated with a space.
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instruction: Output a number between 0 and 7, using the following rules:
                <ol>
                        <li>If there are two cards of the same rank, the player has a Pair. Output 1.</li>
                        <li>If there are two different Pairs in a hand of cards, the player has a Two Pair. Output 2.</li>
                        <li>If there are three cards of the same rank, the player has a Three of a Kind. Output 3.</li>
                        <li>If the five cards' ranks are in a sequence (e.g. K, Q, J, 10, 9), the player has a Straight. Output 4.<br>
                            (Note: 13 (K), 14 (A), 2, 3, 4 is also considered a Straight in this exercise, <a  href="https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~gc00/reviews/pokerrules" target=none><b>but not in the actual game! </b></a>)</li>
                        <li>If there is a Three of a Kind and a Pair in a hand of cards, the player has a Full House. Output 5.</li>
                        <li>If there are four cards of the same rank, the player has a Four of a Kind. Output 6.</li>
                        <li>If all five cards are in a sequence and are of the same suit, the player has a Straight Flush. Output 7.</li>
                        <li>If none of the above apply, the player has a High Card. Output 0.</li>
                </ol>
