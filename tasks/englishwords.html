                Analyzing, Replacing, Inserting, and Deleting English Words

                Spring 2019: Question 11 (use C language to write this program)
                Spring 2018: Question 25 (use C language to write this program)
            </h6>

            <p> <!-- content-->
                In this program, users first input an English sentence, with each word separated with a space. After that, 2 words P and Q are input.
            
            <p>
                This exercise requires you to build a program in C to do the following operations on the sentence:
                <ol>
                    <li>Replace any occurrence of word P in the sentence with Q, and output the modified sentence.</li>
                    <li>Add word Q before any occurrence of P in the sentence, and output the modified sentence.</li>
                    <li>Remove any occurrence of P in the sentence, and output the modified sentence.</li>
                    <li>Analyze the sentence and find out how many times every word appears in the sentence, with the results sorted, based on frequency, from high to low.<br>
                        If more than one word has the same frequency, sort alphabetically from A-Z. Note that uppercase letters (A, B, C, ...)  takes precedence over lowercase letters (a, b, c, ...).</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Input instructions: Input three lines of data.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The first line is the sentence.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The second and third lines represent the two words P and Q.
                    </li>
                </ol>               
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        For the first line, output the sentence with any occurrences of P replaced with Q.                          
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the second line, output the sentence with Q added in front of any occurrence of P.                         
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the third line, output the sentence with any occurrence of P omitted in the output.                          
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From the fourth line onward, output the frequency of every word in order.<br>
                        Each line shows the word, and how many times the word appears in the sentence, separated with a space.
                    </li>
                </ol>
