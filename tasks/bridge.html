                Spring 2018: Question 15 (use Python to make this program)<br>
            </h6>

                There are four suits in a deck of poker cards: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs.<br>
                In this program, these are defined as A, B, C, and D, respectively.<br>
                Each suit contains 13 cards from 1 to 13, for a total of 52 cards in four suits.
            </p>

            <p>
                In this program, each card has a code in this format: number and suit.<br>
                For example, 1A represents the Ace in spades, 7C represents the 7 in diamonds, and 13D represents the King of clubs.
            </p>

            <p>Rank of suits: Spade > Heart > Diamond > Club<br>
                Rank of values: A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9 > ... > 3 > 2</p>

            <p>Input instruction: Input the following in order:
                <ol>
                    <li>In this game, there are 4 players: P1, P2, P3, and P4. P1 and P3 are in one team, and P2 and P4 are in one team.</li>
                    <li>First, every player takes a hand of 13 cards.</li>
                    <li>Then, every player makes a call, starting from P1. Calls continue until “pass” is called three times consecutively, which ends the calling session. At this point, the suit from the last card called becomes the lead suit.</li>
                    <li>After the calls ended, the next player has to play a card from their hand. The first player in every draw round decides the suit to be drawn in that round, and all players must follow the suit played by the player who started the draw. After all four players play a card, the cards are compared. The player who plays a card with the highest overall rank wins the round and gets a point. Three rounds will be played.</li>
                    <li>Note that the lead suit from (3) will have a higher rank than the other three suits.<br>
                        For example: If the lead suit is a club, then the rank of suits will be Club > Spade > Heart > Diamond. This means that, if a player draws out a card belonging to the lead suit, that player wins the round, unless if another player also draws a card which belongs to the lead suit and has a higher value.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>
                Output instructions:
                <ol>
                    <li>Output the number of wins for each player.</li>
                    <li>Output the winning team.</li>
                    <li>If any of the following situations occur, output “ERROR”:
                        <ul>
                            <li>calls that are not done according to the rules</li>
                            <li>during the draw rounds, any player (except the first player to play a card in each round) plays a card that is NOT of the same suit as the suit of the card played by the first player, unless if that player has no cards of that suit</li>
                            <li>a player draws out a card which is not in the player’s hand</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
